Write a program to read the dollar rate, and then a dollar amount to be purchased for
a person in real. Inform how many reais the person will pay for dollars, also considering
that the person will have to pay 6% IOF on the dollar amount. Create a CurrencyConverter class
to be responsible for the calculations.

EXAMPLE:
What is the dollar price? 3.10
How many dollars will be bought? 200.00
Amount to be paid in reais = 657.20
